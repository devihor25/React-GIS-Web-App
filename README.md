# Capstone Space Allocation 

This is the project we did as part of our **50.003 Elements of Software Construction** (ESC) course in **SUTD**
* To improve the workflow for assigning Capstone (project) space for our school's annual Capstone exhibition, we implemented a **Geospatial (GIS)** solution to do space allocation. 
* This was packaged in a web app, employing features such as login, upload of CSV & display of map with Leaflet. 

We had to going through the Software Development process, where we had to do the following:
* Formulate and refinement requirements based on discussions with our client - our school's Capstone Office
* Design and better understand different subsystems through UML diagrams (Class, Use Case & Sequence Diagrams) 
* Implement our solution ("Full Stack" from Postgresql DB <-> Express JS <-> React) 
* Develop system and robustness tests in Selenium (Java)
